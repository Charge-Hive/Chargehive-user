# React Version Compatibility Notice

## Current Configuration

- **React**: 19.1.0
- **React Native**: 0.81.5
- **Expo SDK**: ~54.0.18

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Compatibility Issue

React 19.1.0 is the latest version of React, but it may not be fully compatible with React Native 0.81.5. This combination could lead to unexpected behavior or runtime issues.

### Recommended Actions

#### Option 1: Downgrade React (Safer for Production)

Downgrade to React 18, which is the recommended version for React Native 0.81.x:

```bash
npm install react@18.2.0
```

This is the safest option for production applications.

#### Option 2: Upgrade React Native (More Work, Better Long-term)

Upgrade to the latest React Native version that supports React 19:

```bash
npx expo install --fix
```

This will update all dependencies to compatible versions with your current Expo SDK.

#### Option 3: Keep Current Setup (Not Recommended)

If the app is working fine in your testing:
- Continue with current versions
- Test thoroughly on all target devices
- Monitor for any React-related errors
- Be prepared to downgrade if issues arise
